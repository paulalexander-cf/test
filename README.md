# Cardinal Financial Calculators Overview

Each directory is a standalone calculator. View the README in each directory for more information on its respective calculator.
The goal behind this is to transition from WordPress theme-dependent calculators within CF's portfolio to a more modular and independent solution that can be implemented outside of WordPress (i.e. within an Unbounce campaign).

## Local Environment
